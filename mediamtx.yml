  # Path of recording segments.
  # Extension is added automatically.
  # Available variables are %path (path name), %Y %m %d (year, month, day),
  # %H %M %S (hours, minutes, seconds), %f (microseconds), %z (time zone), %s (unix epoch).

  # Format of recorded segments.
  # Available formats are "fmp4" (fragmented MP4) and "mpegts" (MPEG-TS).
  recordFormat: fmp4
  # fMP4 segments are concatenation of small MP4 files (parts), each with this duration.
  # MPEG-TS segments are concatenation of 188-bytes packets, flushed to disk with this period.
  # When a system failure occurs, the last part gets lost.
  # Therefore, the part duration is equal to the RPO (recovery point objective).
  recordPartDuration: 1s
  # This prevents RAM exhaustion.
  recordMaxPartSize: 50M
  # Minimum duration of each segment.
  recordSegmentDuration: 1m
  # Delete segments after this timespan.
  # Set to 0s to disable automatic deletion.
